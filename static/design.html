				<h2>Pinching pennies when scaling in The Cloud</h2>
				<img class="mainPostImage" src="http://fpoimg.com/900x500"/>
				<p>
					Running a site in the cloud and paying for CPU time with pennies and fractions of pennies is a <em>fascinating</em> way to profile your app. I mean, we all should be profiling our apps, right? Really paying attention to what the CPU does and how many database connections are main, what memory usage is like, but we don't. If that code doesn't affect your pocketbook directly, you're less likely to bother.
				</p>
				<p>
					Interestingly, I find myself performing optimizations driving my hybrid car or dealing with my smartphone's limited data plan. When resources are truly scarce and (most importantly) money is on the line, one finds ways - both clever and obvious - to optimize and cut costs.

				<h3>SLOPPY CODE IN THE CLOUD COSTS MONEY</h3>

				<p>
					I have a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/buy.aspx">MSDN Subscription</a> which includes quite a bit of free Azure Cloud time. Make sure you've turned this on if you have MSDN yourself. This subscription is under my personal account and I pay if it goes over (I don't get a free pass just because I work for the cloud group) so I want to pay as little as possible if I can.</p>
				</p>
				<ul> 
					<li>Save money</li>
					<li>Scale quickly when I need to</li>
				</ul>

					<code>
/**
* Example 1
*/
console.log(x === undefined); // logs "false"
var x = 3;


/**
* Example 2
*/
// will return a value of undefined
var myvar = "my value";

(function() {
	console.log(myvar); // undefined
	var myvar = "local value";
})();
